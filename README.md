# Signal-strength
A simple utility written in powershell to get the intensity of the signal of your wifi.

## Usage :
At the beginning, the program will ask you for the "number of pass", wich you can understand by the number of times it will take a snapshot of the data during the execution. Logically, larger inputs in this section leads to longer but more precise (and therefore more representative) analyses.
After pressing enter, just sit back and relax ;)
